Falcon DB

Project constitution.

1. The purpose

This is to be a high-performance, high troughput, opensource, document store database
with excellent data-mining capabilities.

Database stores BSON objects organized in collections.



2. Programing language and technology

* C++11 for the core product. JavaScript as a (one of) embedded language.
* CMake is the building system
* GCC >= 4.6 is the primary compiler, others could be supported
* x86_64 Linux is the primary target OS, others could be supported

3. Design principles

* Modular! Pluggable frontend, backend, indexes, server-side languages etc.
  Main source tree should contain at least two of each, to ensure that the modularity is achievable.
  - Frontends: HTTP, MongoDB compatible
  - Storage backends: LevelBD, NessDB
* Concurent - minum locking, maximum concurency. Vertical scalability.
* Deterministic resource usage: administrator should be able to limint the amount of threads, memory and disk space used.
